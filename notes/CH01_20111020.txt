Chapter 1:  Introduction

"Java is a tool, and any craftsman who relies on a single tool is going to have a hard time with some jobs"
/* Programming is a "craft" in his eyes.  Not a science or an engineering discipline, it is a "craft" */

- Java is good for large projects with other programmers
- Java runs the same on multiple platforms
  "running everywhere does not mean running optimally everywhere"
- Java is a useful tool when the code you are writing is going to be used for a long time
  "...complexities getting a Java program started...make Java an inconvenient choice for a one-off, quick hack..."
  "Java is best used on systems that are designed before they are built"
- Java is a useful tool if the code you are writing needs to be reliable

We will be talking about "good part of Java, for doing the things that Java is good for doing.".

"But within this large and complex system, there is still the small and simple core system, if you just know where to find it.  The goal of this book is to show that small, simple system that every Java programmer who is using Java for what the language and environment are good for should know."
